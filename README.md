# Description
GUI Maker

This application is equipped with several distance measurement methods such as Single Linkage, Complete Linkage, Average Linkage, Centroid, and Ward which can be used as the selection of the closest distance measurement method when clustering. This application is also able to select the optimal number of clusters using the Pseudo F-Statistics value. The Pseudo F-Statistics value is derived from the calculation of a method called the Calinski-Harabsz Pseudo F-Statistics method. The Calinski-Harabsz Pseudo F-Statistics method is able to find the optimal number of clusters, which are clusters with a high level of homogeneity between members in the cluster and high heterogeneity between clusters formed.
